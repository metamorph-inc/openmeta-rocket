Instructions on creating XML rocket files.

1. Create a clafer design space (*.cfr). Tutorials can be found here: http://t3-necsis.cs.uwaterloo.ca:8091/#learning-clafer
    The clafer MOOVisualizer is a valuable tool during the debugging process. This allows
    the user to quickly test files and see if the constraints added produce expected outcomes.
    This tool also shows the user how many instances there are in the space, and can be found here:
    http://www.clafer.org/p/software.html

    NOTE: The MOOVisualizer does not perform well with large instance spaces (> 1500)

2. Execute master.sh
    The master.sh script does several things. The 1st block creates an image depicting the design
    space in a tree form using GraphViz. This is helpful when trying to understand and demonstrate the complexity
    of larger design spaces. The second block of the master.sh code runs a desktop version of the
    clafer instance generator (ClaferIG) and saves these instances to a directory based on the name
    of the clafer.cfr file read. This will create instances for every *.cfr file in the Clafer-models
    folder so try to keep files in development in the WIP folder. The third block of code will take all of these new instance file and create corresponding
    XML files for use in OpenRocket.

TODO: Future developments will also simulate these instances inside of OpenRocket and save the data.
