===============
Using the NASA Student Launch competition as a case study, OpenRocket was integrated into the OpenMETA framework to demonstrate the
strengths of a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in complex design fields. The MBSE approach allows an engineer to develop a small
number of models, and continuously simulate different variations until an desirable solution is found. In this case study, 972 original
rocket designs were considered. The OpenMETA project in this repo allowed us to narrow down this large design space to a single final
design after several rounds of analysis.
